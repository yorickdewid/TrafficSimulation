Traffic Simulation
====

A simple simulation showing a four way intersection with traffic lights. Cars access the intersection from all directions and based on the current traffic line they wait for the red light or drive straight ahead. The environment simulates four traffic lights and and decides based on an algorithm which direction is next to cross the street. This simple demonstration was intended as an exercise and gives the basic idea of a safe traffic intersection.

### Compiling from source

Traffic Simulation can be compiled from source although it requires [GreenFoot](http://www.greenfoot.org/door) for the additional Java libraries and the execution environment. To do so:

* Download and install GreenFoot
* Create a new project.
* Load the .java files from the repository
* Compile and run the project

Optionally you can download the .jar file and run it using the Java Runtime.
